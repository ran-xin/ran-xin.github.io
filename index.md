## About Me
I am an undergraduate student at the University of Cambridge, interested in the field of <strong>robotics engineering</strong>, with expertise in mechanical design, software implementation, and machine learning. I was a <strong>Product Design Engineer Intern@Apple</strong>, between June 2024, and June 2025. I was the mechanical design leader for my high school's FIRST Robotics Team, where I led the development and implementation of diverse mechanical design projects and oversaw the development, testing, and validation of control algorithms. I was an undergraduate researcher at the University of Cambridge's <strong>Bio-Inspired Robotics Lab</strong> between June 2023 and Feb 2024.

Beyond my aforementioned experiences, I am passionate about applying machine learning to enhance intelligent robotics systems, particularly by optimizing sensor feedback readings and bridging the gap between mechanics and electrical systems. I'm also interested in creating amazing consumer electronic products that would enhance each life.

            <h3>Unibots Robotics Competition 2024</h3>
            <p>I led a team to compete in the competition, focusing on a sustainable design. I utilized FDM printing and laser-cut MDF, guided by Design for Manufacturability (DFM) and Design for Assembly (DFA), to minimize environmental impact and streamline assembly. Through Solidworks simulations, I and my team perfected the designs, ensuring the robot was both efficient and eco-friendly. </p>
